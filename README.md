<h1>Machine-Learning-Patient-Drug-Prediction-Decision-Tree</h1>
<p>This project aims to use a decision tree classification algorithm to construct a model. The model is based on historical patient data and their responses to various medications. The end goal is to predict an unknown patient's classification and find an optimal drug for new patients based on this model.</p>

<h2 id="Data Acquisition">Data Acquisition</h2>
<p>Dataset contains 200 samples of patient information and their response to a particular medication. Each patient's data includes age, sex, blood pressure levels, cholesterol levels, and the ratio of sodium to potassium in the blood.</p>

<h2 id="Preprocessing">Preprocessing</h2>
<p>Before modeling, preprocessing is carried out to convert categorical variables into a format that can be used by the decision tree. Since sklearn Decision Trees do not handle categorical variables, we use one-hot encoding to convert these variables into numerical format. Specifically, the 'Sex', 'BP' (blood pressure level), and 'Cholesterol' categories are transformed.</p>

<h2 id="Modeling">Modeling</h2>
<p>With data properly preprocessed, we proceed to model construction. We create an instance of the DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.tree, specifying 'entropy' as our criterion. This lets us see the information gain of each node. We fit the model with our training feature matrix and response vector.</p>

<h2 id="Prediction">Prediction</h2>
<p>Having built and trained the model, we make predictions on our testing dataset. The predictions are stored for later comparison with the actual values.</p>

<h2 id="Evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>Model performance is crucial in assessing its effectiveness. We use sklearn's metrics module to evaluate our model's accuracy. In tests, the model scored an impressive accuracy of approximately 0.98, indicating high reliability.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Our decision tree model has shown excellent performance in predicting the appropriate medication for patients based on their health profiles. The high accuracy rate suggests that the model has successfully captured the patterns and relationships in the training data.</p>

<h2 id="Benefits">Benefits</h2>
<p>This model has significant potential benefits for healthcare providers. By accurately predicting the most suitable drug for a patient based on their health profile, providers can create more effective treatment plans, potentially improving patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.</p>

<h2 id="Purpose and Impact">Purpose and Impact</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how machine learning, specifically decision tree models, can be used in the healthcare sector to make more informed, data-driven decisions. The potential impact is vast - from improving personalized patient care to optimizing resource allocation in hospitals and clinics.</p>
